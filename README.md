 The app modules are divided two main categories:
 
 ### Feature
 
This category contains all feature modules. Each feature module represents a screen in the application. The main module (app) logically lies under this category. The main module (app) logically lies under this category
 
 ### Common
 
 The modules that are visible to all **feature** modules lies under **common** category. There are 3 modules in **common** category, **presentation**, **data**, and **core**
 
 ### Google Architecture Components
 
 The app implements Google architecture components. Visit the [Guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) for the details.
